TODO

- By default, you don't need this.  We use the subgraph routing URLs that exist in the supergraph.
- Setting these overrides those values.

---

By default, the routing URLs for subgraphs are included in the supergraph during composition, either in Apollo Studio or in Rover.  In the event that you need to override the URL that is provided - for example, to account for changing network topography - you can change override this.

### Example

In this example the `accounts` subgraph URL is overridden to point to `http://localhost:2525` and the value which was specified during composition in either Apollo Studio or Rover will be ignored.

```yaml{3}
override_subgraph_url:
  # subgraph_name: new_url
  accounts: "http://localhost:2525"
```
